# Simple-turret-Arduino-Uno
This is a training task for making an bow-like turret with Arduino Uno and 3 servo

## The main task

in 2.0-2.5 hours, make a turret that will be controlled using 2 large servos and 1 small one. The model must be original. A typical code may be the connection code for Arduino uno servos. The model should move horizontally and vertically, and a small servo is used to "release the shutter." You also need to make a projectile. The finished product should not look too collective.

## Materials and methods

## Turret v 1

In this part, I will describe my attempt to make a turret in the allotted time right during classes in FabLab.

To meet the deadline, I need to plan my work properly. While my classmates were busy connecting the motor to the board, I decided to focus on making the turret itself. It seemed to me that the modeling and manufacturing process would take too much time.
