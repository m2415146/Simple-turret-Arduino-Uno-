# Simple-turret-Arduino-Uno
This is a training task for making an bow-like turret with Arduino Uno and 3 servo

## The main task

in 2.0-2.5 hours, make a turret that will be controlled using 2 large servos and 1 small one. The model must be original. A typical code may be the connection code for Arduino uno servos. The model should move horizontally and vertically, and a small servo is used to "release the shutter." You also need to make a projectile. The finished product should not look too collective.

## Turret v 1

In this part, I will describe my attempt to make a turret in the allotted time right during classes in FabLab.

To meet the deadline, I need to plan my work properly. While my classmates were busy connecting the motor to the board, I decided to focus on making the turret itself. It seemed to me that the modeling and manufacturing process would take too much time.

At first, I decided to search the Internet for models similar to a crossbow to see how other people implemented this idea.

I chose the right one in my opinion.

Now that I saw the example in front of my eyes, it was easier for me to model my crossbow. 

first, it was necessary to determine the size. The size range will dictate the degree of tension of the elastic band, at which its force will be enough to release the projectile.  I know from orthodontics that elastics gain the most strength if they are stretched 2-2,5-3 times. I'm not holding a special elastic in my hands, but just a stationery elastic band. Experimentally, I realized that it is better to stretch it no more than 3 times, since then it bursts. I stretched it with my hands about 2 times, applied a ruler, and it turned out to be about 100 mm.  I decided to proceed from this figure. if there is not enough tension, I will be able to adjust the tension force using a trigger, the role of which will be performed by a small SG90 servo.

### Create a model

To create the model, I used RhinoCeros 7, with which I wanted to create a .dxf format drawing for cutting on a laser engraver made of plywood, since the task time is limited and this will make the model faster than printing on a 3D printer.

to begin with, I created a square with sides of 100*100 mm, so that I would have a guideline for modeling a crossbow of the right size.

then I started modeling the part where the elastic band should be stretched.

The blueprint was almost ready.

The two holes on the model are modeled in order to better attach the base of the crossbow to the bowstring itself.

the drawing was uploaded in the format.DXF in order to produce 3mm plywood on a laser machine.

I decided to glue the parts together using a hot glue gun.
