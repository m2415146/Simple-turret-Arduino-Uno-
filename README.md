# Simple-turret-Arduino-Uno
This is a training task for making an bow-like turret with Arduino Uno and 3 servo

## The main task

in 2.0-2.5 hours, make a turret that will be controlled using 2 large servos and 1 small one. The model must be original. A typical code may be the connection code for Arduino uno servos. The model should move horizontally and vertically, and a small servo is used to "release the shutter." You also need to make a projectile. The finished product should not look too collective.

## Important notes

the repository will be divided into 2 blocks - programming and the build itself. since the part related to programming and the assembly of the modules themselves is the same

## Important Update

Add added g-code/3mf with final v2 models for FF a5m (pro)

## Programming and assembly of electronic components

first, I need to connect the Arduino to the expansion board. In order to do this correctly, I found a diagram on the Internet.

![Screenshot_88](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64a835e9-e321-4ff4-802b-9713745c769a)

in this diagram, I see a signed pinout, because I have an expansion board in my hands, where there are no labels.

here you can see what the connection of the modules will look like.

and here's what the result of connecting an Arduino to an expansion board should look like.

ready

![Screenshot_94](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33fc1f9e-40e8-4913-a537-86685f084f52)

The activation code and and also the connection diagram was found by me on the [Arduino website].(https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/electronics/servo-motors/).

![Screenshot_96](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8358fef5-2f89-406e-b134-ff9c3d1befc3)

```#include <Servo.h>

Servo myservo;  // create servo object to control a servo

int potpin = 0;  // analog pin used to connect the potentiometer
int val;    // variable to read the value from the analog pin

void setup() {
  myservo.attach(9);  // attaches the servo on pin 9 to the servo object
}

void loop() {
  val = analogRead(potpin);            // reads the value of the potentiometer (value between 0 and 1023)
  val = map(val, 0, 1023, 0, 180);     // scale it to use it with the servo (value between 0 and 180)
  myservo.write(val);                  // sets the servo position according to the scaled value
  delay(15);                           // waits for the servo to get there
}
```
then I connected the servos and potentiometers as shown in the diagram above

![Screenshot_97](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bb40149-a567-4e25-a4a1-83e247cdc4d1)

![Screenshot_98](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9734537-7eee-4316-a2f7-6b49ba6b0fcb)

then I entered the code into the Arduino IDE program and started editing it, since in the example from the Arduino website, only one motor could be used.

the code to copy with descriptions

```
#include <Servo.h> // activate the library for working with servos (it is available by default, you do not need to download it)

Servo myservo1;  // create servo object to control a servo1, there is a difference from examples code - we need to mark our servo by servo1 and servo2
Servo myservo2;

int potpin1 = 0;  // analog pin used to connect the potentiometer, we need to mark it like in example with servo
int potpin2 = 1; // use correct analogue pin number from my connection
int val1;    // variable to read the value from the analog pin, need to mark it also
int val2;

void setup() {
  myservo1.attach(9);  // attaches the servo on pin 9 to the servo object
  myservo1.attach(10); // need to use correct pin number from my connection and also mark it
}

void loop() {
  val1 = analogRead(potpin1);            // reads the value of the potentiometer (value between 0 and 1023)
  val1 = map(val1, 0, 1023, 0, 180);     // scale it to use it with the servo (value between 0 and 180)
  myservo1.write(val1);                  // sets the servo position according to the scaled value
  delay(15);                           // waits for the servo to get there

  val2 = analogRead(potpin2);            // write command for 2 servo and also mark all
  val2 = map(val2, 0, 1023, 0, 180);     
  myservo2.write(val2);                  
  delay(15);    
}
```
result

everything is working. now we need to connect the third SG90 servo by analogy.

final corrected code from sg90

```
#include <Servo.h>

Servo myservo1;
Servo myservo2;
Servo myservo3;

int val1, val2;
int servo3Position = 90;
int buttonState = 0;

void setup() {
  myservo1.attach(SERVO_PIN1);
  myservo2.attach(SERVO_PIN2);
  myservo3.attach(SERVO_PIN3);
  pinMode(BUTTON_PIN, INPUT); 
}

void loop() {
  val1 = map(analogRead(POT_PIN1), 0, 1023, 0, 180);
  myservo1.write(val1);
  
  val2 = map(analogRead(POT_PIN2), 0, 1023, 0, 180);
  myservo2.write(val2);

  buttonState = digitalRead(BUTTON_PIN);
  
  if (buttonState == HIGH) {  
    if (servo3Position < 180) {
      servo3Position += 5;  
    }
    delay(1);
  } else {
    if (servo3Position > 0) {
      servo3Position -= 5; 
    }
    delay(1);
  }
  
  myservo3.write(servo3Position);
  delay(15);
}
```

## Turret v 1

In this part, I will describe my attempt to make a turret in the allotted time right during classes in FabLab.

To meet the deadline, I need to plan my work properly. While my classmates were busy connecting the motor to the board, I decided to focus on making the turret itself. It seemed to me that the modeling and manufacturing process would take too much time.

At first, I decided to search the Internet for models similar to a crossbow to see how other people implemented this idea.

[Other people models](https://www.printables.com/search/models?ctx=models&q=crossbow)

![Screenshot_75](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9057c25-a1b0-4178-ac8c-f98866b3ce4b)

I chose the right one in my opinion.

[Model crossbow](https://www.printables.com/model/742153-giant-crossbow)

![Screenshot_76](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/010ce454-8555-4d2f-9f24-dc2ed94aa9b9)

Now that I saw the example in front of my eyes, it was easier for me to model my crossbow. 

first, it was necessary to determine the size. The size range will dictate the degree of tension of the elastic band, at which its force will be enough to release the projectile.  I know from orthodontics that elastics gain the most strength if they are stretched 2-2,5-3 times. I'm not holding a special elastic in my hands, but just a stationery elastic band. Experimentally, I realized that it is better to stretch it no more than 3 times, since then it bursts. I stretched it with my hands about 2 times, applied a ruler, and it turned out to be about 100 mm.  I decided to proceed from this figure. if there is not enough tension, I will be able to adjust the tension force using a trigger, the role of which will be performed by a small SG90 servo.

### Create a model

To create the model, I used RhinoCeros 7, with which I wanted to create a .dxf format drawing for cutting on a laser engraver made of plywood, since the task time is limited and this will make the model faster than printing on a 3D printer.

to begin with, I created a square with sides of 100*100 mm, so that I would have a guideline for modeling a crossbow of the right size.

![Screenshot_77](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/836936fb-941b-4746-8668-f4247e396cef)

then I started modeling the part where the elastic band should be stretched.

![Screenshot_78](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82165a4e-787f-4cde-a70d-83154c921393)

The blueprint was almost ready.

![Screenshot_79](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31eb1600-2889-4e61-9424-c8fe353bed2f)

The two holes on the model are modeled in order to better attach the base of the crossbow to the bowstring itself.

the drawing was uploaded in the format.DXF in order to produce 3mm plywood on a laser machine.

got it

![Screenshot_81](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ca4dff2-bcd9-4e1b-bdfa-ee8b22f016d3)

I decided to glue the parts together using a hot glue gun.

![Screenshot_82](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2002f8fc-a8ce-40f7-aa1f-89b2f383b9fc)

at that moment, I folded the model and thought about how to implement vertical and horizontal movement. for some reason, the option of putting one servo on top of another did not occur to me, and I decided to implement vertical movement using the "living hinge". I have modeled a (not the most successful) option in RHinoceros. The idea was that the servo, which controls vertical movement, would be connected by an elastic band to a live loop, so I could move the turret vertically. This solution does not look efficient and reliable enough, but it is copyrighted and it could have been tried to be implemented before the deadline.

the first version was absolutely terrible

![Screenshot_83](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f4269f6-e673-4f34-8dbe-bbb4f17eeafe)

the second one looked more acceptable (I positioned the hinges more tightly to increase strength) and sent it to CorelDRAW to prepare for laser cutting on 3mm plywood.

![Screenshot_84](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0468ce49-591e-4349-9f3e-e5662b3b701b)

I also added the same fasteners that are used to fix the elastic band tightening mechanism - I thought it would be useful for better fixation.

Got it

![Screenshot_85](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f77a1917-f86d-4024-a038-401da200172d)

The photo shows that when trying to extract the living hinge from the laser cutter, it broke in half. After holding it in my hands, I decided that it might be worth gluing 2 pieces together to increase strength.

there will be no photos of the process of gluing parts together using a hot glue gun, as my hands are stuck to the glue, everything is stuck to the glue, even the glue is stuck to the glue. the most unpleasant sensation was getting a finger burn from hot glue, which I couldn't remove from my finger because it was too fluid. Since it was too far to the sink, I had to train my acceptance.

Result

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae79b114-2efe-4ec7-8a89-1d0a6769c2d3

well, it was a good instructive moment, thanks to which I realized not only the disadvantages of this approach, but also that a hot-glue gun can create an elastic cushion for gluing plywood. Unfortunately, in my case it looks like a toy picked up in the trash.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc7b1274-f686-4c80-a61b-709a692c9290

Still, I had to check if it could handle the elastic band tension function.

### Create connecting parts with motors

in order to model the mounts, I need ready-made files with motors. I don't see the point in modeling them from scratch, since I can handle this task and I don't see the point in wasting time on it. other people have already done this. the meaning of my task is different

I took the model files from [this site].(https://grabcad.com/library/tag/mg995)

![Screenshot_99](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f0271b0-cbe8-4294-acb1-3cc5a682507d)

[MG995 Servo].(https://grabcad.com/library/mg995-servo-3)

[mounting on the "asterisk" motor].(https://grabcad.com/library/mg995-star-horn-gear-1)

The first iteration will be with the simplest way to place the motors: one on top of the other. in fact, I will need to model the fasteners for them and make a platform so that the structure does not tip over.

First, let's start by importing the engines themselves. I imported a file format from various files in the archive into RhinoCeros 8.IGS

![Screenshot_100](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9eff4dd6-cec1-4c1f-85ab-653fd5e2dc2d)

I use a motor mount in the same format. after importing into Rhino, I turned the motor so that the rotating part was pointing upwards, and the mount coincided with this part.

![Screenshot_101](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89784c4f-a22a-496c-949e-c55aa8222dd7)

the approximate location is ready. to do this, I combined and copied the motor with the mount and positioned it so that vertical movement was possible.

![Screenshot_102](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b19bd237-ebad-4501-bdc2-a1ab247b41af)

at that moment, it became clear to me that vertical movement would be implemented in a slightly different way. to do this, I asked google a question and this is what it answered me.:

![Screenshot_103](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c987ed6-af8e-4c98-a1af-450e4cbd3a63)

I found an [interesting article on habr].(https://habr.com/ru/articles/200516/) that explained to me how movement along different axes would occur.

![Screenshot_104](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/883cbc34-1ea2-41e1-aad8-c2761a9dc43f)

at that moment, I thought about the fact that the cannon would have to be shifted to the side even more than I thought. but for now, I'm not going to think about how to position it vertically, as my head is already boiling.

it is also better to imagine the movement of the cannon, I was helped by such a drawing from the same google query.

![Screenshot_106](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b56b44a-d93f-4af5-9d82-4c88489fb651)

now I know that such a mechanism is called a "swivel cannon".

Now it's time to add the [SG90 servo model].(https://grabcad.com/library/4145-towerpro-sg90-mini-servo-sunrobotics_in-1) here.

![Screenshot_107](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5664552b-2886-4c32-8d4f-8f97baf16031)

The movement system is increasingly coming together. I imported the SG90 model in the format.STEP (this, of course, was worth doing with other models). I may still be moving the models between each other, but the general scheme is already clear. Now I need to think about how I'm going to connect the motors together.

![Screenshot_108](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec320de7-fc21-4163-bdf4-56e73161ac8e)

Nevertheless, I decided to position the SG90 differently, since it should act as a trigger.

![Screenshot_109](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25d2857b-b6dc-4efa-ba0e-ac05c9771f5b)

actually, at this stage it would be possible to look for special holders for servomotors, but I wanted to model them myself.

in real life, I started modeling the "advanced" version 2 at this stage, and returned to this one later.

### Create a model

The first part of creating models is described in version 1.

There have been many corrections and alterations. So I will focus only on the main points.

this is the final result after several corrections.

![Screenshot_126](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75c7ad07-f00d-44c9-a4c3-fbd35eef6203)

I've taken a few points as a basis.: 

1) Since, due to the location of the engines I have chosen, the turret will have a clear shift in the center of gravity towards the cannon itself, I decided to create a large base that should give stability to the structure;
2) also, for balance, I positioned the volumetric part in the opposite direction from the gun. initially, I wanted to make a support wheel there, which would provide another fulcrum, but I decided that I would have to make changes to the design, which would take too much time anyway, and abandoned this idea.;
3) the motors will be fixed by matching the shape of the holders to the shape of the motors;
4) The upper part of each of the motors will remain free. instead of screws, I will try to use specially modeled pins on the holders.;
5) the big problem (which made me redo the holders) was that I underestimated the size of the wire. There should be plenty of room in the final version;
6) I wanted to avoid angular shapes as much as possible in order to train myself to a different visual mindset during modeling, as well as to make the turret more stylish.;
7) I use PLAY filament for printing, as it prints quickly and has a fairly low shrinkage;
8) during the simulation, I did NOT provide for shrinkage compensation, nor did I adjust the geometry to make the landing of the motor more free. keep this in mind if you try to repeat the project.;
9) I turned out to have too many components and to fix them with each other, I probably have to use an acrylate glue. I should have made the structure more monolithic;
10) the weaknesses that are obvious to me at the moment, while the final sample is being printed, are the fixation of holders with nozzles on the motors and excessive load on the vertical servo;

### Important notes

now I will focus on a few points in more detail, since I am not sure that I have the strength to describe the modeling step by step.

this is what the model version looked like when I was still planning to make a wheel as an additional support for a vertical servo. there were flaws, for example, one layer at a time on the cutouts of the crossbow, an unfinished arrow, but at this stage I launched the printing platform, as well as horizontal and vertical holders for the servo. At that moment, the idea of "hiding the wires inside the structure" seemed attractive to me, but I did not approach it carefully enough.

![Screenshot_110](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48ebe76c-ac53-420f-858b-aa52fa60cd89)

The printer is FlashForge V5 Pro, the filament is Pla Geeetech, printing is carried out from a Reality Space Plus filament dryer, the filament was dried at 50 degrees, heating was about 1-1.5 hours before printing. Slicing in the OrcaSLicer 2.2 0.4  nozzle.

I had to redo the holder for the SG90 servo, as its rounded shape did not allow it to be adequately positioned on the printing table.

![Screenshot_112](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41263715-8a48-408f-a516-308f40725453)

I either had to change the model from scratch or add a plane to it so that it could be adequately printed.

![Screenshot_117](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b98a247-f346-4a55-a8b0-a2fe37106156)

despite the modification of the model, I had to use the support. this is my first experience of manually setting supports. I have drawn the areas where, in my opinion, it is necessary to put tree supports.

![Screenshot_119](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a324558a-7ed8-4ad4-b006-d5909ba78c86)

I also had to print the parts vertically to balance the center of gravity (because of their convex shape). I didn't want to change the form, so I also used the support

![Screenshot_120](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48b3b4b9-3213-43f6-8559-780e0470d84a)

the result of the first print

![Screenshot_127](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bee1a559-470d-4140-a7f0-2a3a3f1250dc)

the horizontal motor holder fits perfectly into the platform. but there were problems with attaching the motor to the nozzle, which is why I had to redo the part. the problem arose because I got confused in the large number of objects on the screen and missed what I had done with the "Boolean difference"

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25f7b200-42bd-44e9-91b0-6c6e4b00b803

The fit of the lower part of the motor seemed normal and tight enough to me, but I couldn't check it because I made a mistake with the size of the channel for the wires.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65a23e0b-7391-4b7f-87bc-26e12df502be

the problem with the channel for the wires was that it was not large enough

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c884aaf5-ebb3-4648-a74f-3de0955774e6

I tried to solve this problem by using dental micro-examination.

![5411559949038908745](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/464c4bfc-d638-444f-ad3b-55859c9d93e6)

unfortunately, there were chips, which turned out to be quite difficult to remove. Perhaps the problem is partly related to the low melting point of PLA, and during processing at 30,000 rpm, it was locally heated and the chips were slightly fused. I was trying to use wire cutters and a wrench for the nuts from my 3d printer

![5411559949038908746](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6faee17-adc7-49bd-82b1-02a20860c1ee)

finally, I decided to leave the platform, as it remained functional after the correction. The correction of the holders did not work out, so I decided to fix the errors on the 3d model itself and re-print it.

![5411559949038908748](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b86bc23-b033-47a9-a96d-5f817f422102)

during the correction of 3D models, the "channels" for the wires became too large and the overhang area increased. I had to make the roof of the channel rounded to improve the print quality.

But there was some problems. again, I did not provide enough space for the wires, because I did not appreciate that I needed to provide ways to insert the motor into the holder. To fix this, I had to use a dental machine again to drill the models.

![Screenshot_237](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c9e318c-7909-4f89-93b8-636fa9b86781)

after the modification, the fixation of the motors in the holders became excellent. I also had to remove the internal bushings, since the motors are held by fixing the walls of the motors with a holder.

let's check the fixation of the horizontal motor holder in the platform

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ac87a01-2f8f-43cb-a191-a22ad174774b

the weak part of the project also becomes obvious - the idea of installing a holder in the nozzles for motors clearly failed.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52dfdcd5-58bd-42e1-8c4a-2cefd9eaca6b

There is also a good fixation of the sg90 servo into its holder.

![Screenshot_240](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a3b36d9-b999-402f-b833-7b09b3aa01b0)

there was a problem with one of the parts for assembling the bow - I did not provide the tolerances and the beam got stuck inside the hemisphere. I didn't like the option of sawing it, since the walls are quite thin and I can permanently damage the model.

![Screenshot_241](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20956203-14a2-47d8-809d-01030c383d5d)

to install the beam in the hemisphere, it had to be literally hammered there.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4b011a6-cd29-4493-bc1e-ecf17208657e

Fortunately, everything worked out.

![Screenshot_242](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5d4edb7-ddc7-425e-9859-565c75269659)

I also did not provide for a good fixation of the adapter from the sg90 servo to the bow. this happened because I got confused about Boolean operations and didn't cut out everything. I also did not provide for the distance at which the nozzle on the sg90 is located from the servo housing itself.

![Screenshot_243](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60f27f8e-50f7-4972-9384-cc9b2efef8a2)

since this problem became apparent already at school and there is no dental motor in FabLab, I tried using a screwdriver.

![Screenshot_244](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ea01f2c-1892-497b-996b-60dc239940de)

In order not to damage my hands during this process, I tried to fix the model using a special FabLab holder and pliers. I do not recommend repeating this experience because of the poor fixation of the model during drilling.

![Screenshot_245](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d79f099-db70-452f-b58b-5bbd032159fb)

despite my efforts, the result was unsatisfactory. I didn't want to re-model the model and print it, but I guess I'll have to do this.

![Screenshot_246](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a983f141-6036-4a36-a6d9-20c3271443bc)

in order to remove the supports from the parts that are supposed to balance the structure, I used special pliers from a 3D printer.

![Screenshot_247](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f65c65e2-feea-4397-bb40-48a0fc05c8ea)

the result was acceptable . my first experience with installing the supports manually on an FDM printer turned out to be successful

![Screenshot_248](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3642354b-7555-445d-88b5-1bf43eccdd06)

I re-modeled the adapter from the sg90 servo to the bow in Rhino, also made a new arrow model so that it was wider and better fixed on the bow plane, and also added 2 models of small supports for better fixation of the bow in the adapter to the sg90

The adapter for sg90 servos was a great fit. I was worried about fixing it with the motor, but it holds without additional accessories.

![Screenshot_255](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fe648ad-8fa1-4160-b292-00628954b655)

It is worth adding that the nozzles for the servo were also glued with a hot-glue gun to the holders themselves.

at this stage, I double-checked the wiring connection again. in fact, it was at this stage that I changed the program code so that the sg90 servo would work (a reference to the programming point)

Let's check the mobility of the cannon

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06f000eb-c887-46e0-982a-5e6f9a20a641

an important point: I did not use the arrow that I originally printed for two reasons: I made it too narrow for the bow platform and it also turned out to be too light. so I used an arrow that I modeled based on the size of the landing pad. here we found out another nuance: the landing pad turned out to be too short in length, which is why the boom was outweighed by the leading edge. to fix this, I glued the failed parts to the tail of the boom to change the center of gravity. It's not much, but it has improved the situation a bit.

![Screenshot_260](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3f318ed-651b-4116-a4b0-2d0d5246ec56)

I also had to connect the wires to each other to increase the distance to the microcontroller somewhat.

the task has already been completed. But let's check how the cannon fires.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0ba1162-a51b-4361-8790-3373cb76dddb

Of course, I wouldn't call it a powerful weapon, but the cannon works.

### What's next?

if I have time, I want to change the model. here are a few points that I want to fix: hide the wires inside the cannon body; change the fixation of the parts with each other so that glue is not required; change the shape of the bow and arrow to improve balance and range; make a housing for the microcontroller so that a beautiful and functional control panel comes out; change the design so as to reduce the number of elements, which the model consists of. These points will help me to work on mistakes, train my engineering thinking and take into account the difficult moments of modeling and assembly in the future.

## Turret v3

Now I had new tasks in front of me: the arrow of the crossbow should pierce the balloon, the crossbow should be multi-shot and with automatic reloading. To achieve these goals, I decided to increase the power of the shot and not use life hacks like my colleagues by putting a needle on the arrowhead.

### Existing models

The biggest problem was to make automatic recharging, so I started looking for existing analogues to use the principles from there.

[the model with automatic recharge, which formed the basis of my design]([https://www.example.com](https://makerworld.com/en/models/220558-china-zhuge-crossbow-v3-0-zhuge-liannu-v3-0-editio#profileId-239063))

I spent more than a week trying to figure out how the bowstring capture mechanism is implemented, until I reviewed this capture. Printing a model for this purpose was not considered by me, as the printing process would take more than 20 hours.

![2025-06-07_14-12-55](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4532f713-ab86-4d98-be0a-8ad7460280d5)

The principle of a block crossbow is also implemented here, although there are no rotating blocks themselves. This principle is realized by connecting the arms of the crossbow to the body.

![2025-06-07_14-14-51](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e475131-c8d0-48b8-8a0f-6317940b9f05)

This model was used by me in order to construct the blocks. in fact, in the first iterations, I used blocks from there, just reducing them in size, until it turned out that I needed to change their structure on my own for my model.

This model made me think that it is good to use live loops in the construction of a crossbow for greater elasticity.

This model made me think that blocks can help give strength to my shot and simplify the tension of the bowstring.

I should definitely mention this real reversible block crossbow, as it served as the basis for planning the placement of blocks of my design.

### Conclusions

After researching this topic for 2 weeks, I realized that developing a reversible block crossbow would be effective for my model. its advantages:
1. Powerful shot
2. Automatic reloading, combined with a trigger and tension system for the bowstring, which I can implement with a single motor.
3. As compact as possible, given my design, due to the reversible shoulder width
4. The system itself is complex and has appeared on the market of real crossbows in the last few years.

### Model

![2025-06-07_14-41-11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d813a7e-f371-4bf0-b7f1-4733cf934ffc)

The model was created using Rhinoceros 8. There have been many iterations. Given the number of elements, I had to master the placement of different parts on different layers, perform multiple Boolean operations, and so on. At the moment, it has the following elements:

1. Reversible blocks and the part combining them (indicated in green). The design of the living loops is applied for the purpose of limited elasticity, and the connection of these parts to each other is made using long metal screws M3

![2025-06-07_14-48-09](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/565805d0-6b46-4ae5-95a9-55f7cdb1979d)

2. Each shoulder is a monolithic structure with cutouts all over to reduce weight.

![2025-06-07_14-50-20](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1899cf08-92b2-4ba3-986a-70eef5dcc979)

3. The blocks were created by me on the basis of the model of the crossbow with blocks, which I showed above, by tearing off the surface from the original blocks, converting them into a volumetric geometry using the extrusion and cap procedure, I also adjusted them to the size of my crossbow, increased the diameter of the internal concavity for the bowstring to ensure its better fixation during operation. The blocks are 2 models: complex and simple, there are 3 floors of blocks - the upper one for the main bowstring, as well as the middle and lower ones for the bowstring of the blocks themselves, which will be connected to each other (right and left) crosswise. Fixing the blocks in the shoulders with the help of bushings, which were also modeled by me

![2025-06-07_14-51-33](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1aa4128c-d396-4c28-8f2a-86c302afc92a)

3. The crossbow bed consists of 2 models: the upper one, which is also a magazine for 7-9 arrows, the lower one, which is motionlessly connected to the base of the crossbow, is needed so that the movement of the upper one takes place around it. There are 2 cutouts - on the magazine there is a cutout for the entrance of the main bowstring, it is equipped with a cutout for gripping the bowstring. There is also a cutout in the base for placing bowstrings.

![2025-06-07_14-57-12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6548f519-54d6-4404-8759-60439d1a242c)

The openings in the magazine are designed to reduce the weight of the structure.

![2025-06-07_14-59-53](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4f19c5c-e77c-4c6a-a8b1-c3e1c1f9085b)

The star on the front of the store performs a purely decorative function. Since the Chinese author marked out the image of a dragon in the original multi-shot model of the crossbow, I decided that the crossbow from Russia could well have an image of a star.

![2025-06-07_15-01-23](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd38881c-8766-4c8d-b1bb-93523a3f1f7b)

4. The star on the front of the store performs a purely decorative function. Since the Chinese author marked out the image of a dragon in the original multi-shot model of the crossbow, I decided that the crossbow from Russia could well have an image of a star.

5. The gears were modeled by me using an online gear generator. The gear ratio is 2.5. A small gear is mounted on the servo shaft, while a large gear transmits rotation to a lever that makes the swam magazine rotate.

![2025-06-07_15-08-59](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/769b908e-241f-4836-a911-ea9245de8ccb)

in order to reduce the weight of the structure, I did not place the gears on the other side, replacing them with levers, which I connected to the axis of rotation of the gears using specially modeled bushings, into which I also inserted M3 screws.

![2025-06-07_15-11-05](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f9f00cc-d7ab-4e23-a6fa-ea0920393523)

6. Since the weight of the magazine has increased significantly, and the tension of the bowstring must also be taken into account, I used the MG995 servo instead of the SG90 to make it do the job. I connected it to the base of the crossbow, fixed it with gears using a system of bushings and caps.

![2025-06-07_15-13-06](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90ac694d-1582-4090-bb20-0292397c2b6d)

7. the system of connecting the motor to the base of the crossbow required the creation of a complex

![2025-06-07_15-15-06](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2615821f-3928-49ad-9902-801d2b954870)

8. To connect to the rotating crossbow plate, given its size and weight, I had to use a two-point fixation: in the area of the motor installation, as well as an arc-shaped crossbar, which is fixed to the back of the crossbow. The arched crossbar not only stabilizes the crossbow during firing, but, if necessary, it can be replaced with a springy part like live loops to reduce vibrations during firing and increase the accuracy of the shot.

![2025-06-07_15-16-30](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45496712-34a4-42d3-a062-f6a391ad1b80)

9. in order to reduce the load on the axis of the servo, which drives the crossbow to rotate vertically, I used the bearing design to distribute the load over the area. One part of it consists of a convex radial part, and the other consists of a correspondingly radially concave one.

![2025-06-07_15-18-42](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71bf800e-dc31-4e24-8c5c-936f711f20ff)

10. To stabilize the crossbow platform, I used an additional three-point mount on the surface, which is mounted on an existing platform.

![2025-06-07_15-20-18](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/594b9efc-d607-4b7a-9361-0c64461877de)

11. Arrow. A special mention should be made of the modification of its shape: in order to move the center of gravity of the arrow closer to the front of the arrow, I used a variable diameter - the arrow expands to the tip and narrows to the shank. it also reduces the friction of the arrow in the channel of the crossbow. Additionally, given that my design does not provide for the tail of the boom, to stabilize it in flight, I used grooves that I modeled at equal distances from each other in the rear of the boom to stabilize it during flight.

![2025-06-07_15-22-20](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cffb0b75-c8f0-4549-8db6-85d5874de520)

### A ready-made crossbow

It was made using 3D printing from Petg with a hybrid and cellular filling of 60-80%. The shoulders, as well as the base of the crossbow, are made of Petg-cf composite material with 65% filling.

### conclusions

The design turned out to be more complicated than I initially thought. Unknowingly, I chose the most complex block design - asynchronous. The big problem is how to use the material for the bowstring. The main problem is how to fix it so that the tension does not weaken. Despite this, a lot of work has been done and there is a really promising field for further development. Among other things, the task is to stabilize the rotation of the magazine and the gears themselves by adding new fixation points and changing the tolerances. the biggest problem for me was the problem of choosing the right tolerances in this model.
